@inproceedings{DavenportEtAl:2023,
 abstract = {McCallum-style Cylindrical Algebra Decomposition (CAD) is a major improvement on the original Collins version, and has had many subsequent advances, notably for total or partial equational constraints. But it suffers from a problem with nullification. The recently-justified Lazard-style CAD does not have this problem. However, transporting the equational constraints work to Lazard-style does reintroduce nullification issues. This paper explains the problem, and the solutions to it, based on the second author’s Ph.D. thesis and the Brown–McCallum improvement to Lazard. With a single equational constraint, we can gain the same improvements in Lazard-style as in McCallum-style CAD. Moreover, our approach does not fail where McCallum would due to nullification. Unsurprisingly, it does not achieve the same level of improvement as it does in the non-nullified cases. We also consider the case of multiple equational constraints.},

@article{EnglandEtAl:2020,
 abstract = {Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) has long been one of the most important algorithms within Symbolic Computation, as a tool to perform quantifier elimination in first order logic over the reals. More recently it is finding prominence in the Satisfiability Checking community, as a tool to identify satisfying solutions of problems in nonlinear real arithmetic. The original algorithm produces decompositions according to the signs of polynomials, when what is usually required is a decomposition according to the truth of a formula containing those polynomials. One approach to achieve that coarser (but hopefully cheaper) decomposition is to reduce the polynomials identified in the CAD to reflect a logical structure which reduces the solution space dimension: the presence of Equational Constraints (ECs). This paper may act as a tutorial for the use of CAD with ECs: we describe all necessary background and the current state of the art. In particular, we present recent work on how McCallum's theory of reduced projection may be leveraged to make further savings in the lifting phase: both to the polynomials we lift with and the cells lifted over. We give a new complexity analysis to demonstrate that the double exponent in the worst case complexity bound for CAD reduces in line with the number of ECs. We show that the reduction can apply to both the number of polynomials produced and their degree.},

 abstract = {In 1994 Lazard proposed an improved method for cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD). The method comprised a simplified projection operation together with a generalized cell lifting (that is, stack construction) technique. For the proof of the method's validity Lazard introduced a new notion of valuation of a multivariate polynomial at a point. However a gap in one of the key supporting results for his proof was subsequently noticed. In the present paper we provide a complete validity proof of Lazard's method. Our proof is based on the classical parametrized version of Puiseux's theorem and basic properties of Lazard's valuation. This result is significant because Lazard's method can be applied to any finite family of polynomials, without any assumption on the system of coordinates. It therefore has wider applicability and may be more efficient than other projection and lifting schemes for CAD.},

That method, however, fails if f is nullified (in McCallum’s terminology): we call the set where this happens a curtain.
